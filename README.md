# rock_paper_scissors

first javascript programm built from scratch. The idea is to develop a rock paper scissors game against the computer.

function computerplay :
    plan : there will be an constant array with the only 3 possibility of rock, paper or scissor
           then i'll take the length of my array and generated a random number within from 0 to my array length
           since that number generated will be the index of my array, then, i'll just print array with that index on the console.log

           
    peudocode : 
        - declaration of our constant variable "computeChoice" array of string R, P, S.
        - declaration of our constant variable "randomIndex" a random number generated from 0 to array length
        - return our array "computeChoice" with our randomIndex.
